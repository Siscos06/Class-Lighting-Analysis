# Study of the Lighting Conditions of a Classroom



This repository created to gather all the code used during the experimental activity for **TECNOLOGIES DEL MEDI AMBIENT I SOSTENIBILITAT - Curs 2025 - 2026**. 

*Made by Francesc Ortiz Rúbies, Joan Carné Rué i Adrià Amorós Sanchez.*



#### Contents

Several coding languages and file have been used to perform different tasks, which are described down below:



###### [IrradiationDataProcesser.py](https://github.com/Siscos06/Class-Lighting-Analysis/blob/50222c68fe58a59c789be88eb1a01f6d828ce8cf/IrradiationDataProcesser.py)

It mainly uses [*pandas*](https://pandas.pydata.org/about/) library to sort and perform some calculations to get significant data out of the last 7 years of irradiation data recorded in [*Lleida - La Femosa*](https://www.meteo.cat/observacions/xema/dades?codi=YJ) Station.



###### [OutilersRemovingSystem.py ](https://github.com/Siscos06/Class-Lighting-Analysis/blob/50222c68fe58a59c789be88eb1a01f6d828ce8cf/OutilersRemovingSystem.py)

It mainly uses [*pandas*](https://pandas.pydata.org/about/) and [*numpy*](https://numpy.org/) libraries to analyze and remove outliers from a dataset using IQR and Modified Z Method.
